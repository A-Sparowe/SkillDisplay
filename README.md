## SkillDisplay
A simple no-frills ACTWebSocket overlay for showing actions pressed in an overlay window.

## Installation
Make sure the 'Using BeforeLogLineRead' box is checked in ACTWebSocket then click the 'Add URL' button to add this URL:
https://a-sparowe.github.io/SkillDisplay/

## Troubleshooting
I have only tested and confirmed this working on the QT5.8.0 variant of OverlayProc with ACTWebSocket 1.3.3.9 so if you are having trouble please use these versions.

If you find any strange bugs, please report to me on here or find me on the ACT FFXIV discord.

## Preview
                                              Updated Preview Coming Soon!
    
   * Plan to edit the skin/theme files to provide a darker background and options for adding custom background images.
   * Also considering implementing a way to show static layouts for Openers and Rotations. These will display above or
     the current SkillDisplay feed to provide references to which abilities the player should be using. 
     Since I myself am I new player to FFXIV I would personally benefit from this addition as I'm sure there are others
     out there who would also benefit from it as well.
